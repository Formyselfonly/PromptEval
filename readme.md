# Rule
## Prompt Guide for user
1.A well-structured prompt should be:
1.1.Clear & Specific: Avoid ambiguity and state exactly what you want.
1.2.Contextual: Provide relevant background information.
1.3.Structured: Use formatting like bullet points or step-by-step instructions when needed.
1.4.Expected Output Defined: Mention the format you want (e.g., “Return the answer as a table” or “Provide a JSON response”).
1.5.Examples (if needed): Provide a sample response for better guidance.
2. Common Prompting Techniques
2.1 Instruction-Based Prompting
Directly tell the AI what to do.
✅ Example:
"Summarize this article in three bullet points."
"Translate this sentence into French: 'Hello, how are you?'"

2.2 Role-Based Prompting
Ask the AI to act as a specific role.
✅ Example:
"Act as a product manager and draft a PRD for an AI chatbot."
"You are a legal advisor. Explain GDPR compliance in simple terms."
2.3 Few-Shot Prompting
Provide examples to guide the AI’s response.
✅ Example:
**"Convert these sentences to active voice:
The cake was baked by Mary. → Mary baked the cake.
The report was written by John. → ?"**
2.4 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Encourage AI to think step by step.
✅ Example:
"Solve this math problem step by step: 152 × 47."
"Analyze the sentiment of this review step by step before giving a final answer."
2.5 Delimiter-Based Prompting
Use clear separators to avoid confusion.
✅ Example:
"Extract the key points from this text:
'''
[Paste text here]
''' "
